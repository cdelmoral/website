            My work focuses on building scalable, secure, and user-friendly systems that automate
            the full lifecycle of R&D outsourcing‚Äîfrom vendor discovery to contract execution and
            payment. I'm passionate about developing tools that reduce operational friction,
            allowing scientists and researchers to concentrate on innovation while we handle the
            logistics behind the scenes.
